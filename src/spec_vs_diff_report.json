  "summary": "Diff implements parts of the admin access guard and several admin pages with safer loading/error states, plus a reusable AdminCapabilityNotice. However, the diff evidence does not show completion of the full required admin room set, invite accept flow, approvals/editing flows, or comprehensive admin navigation verification across all required rooms. The diff also includes multiple unrelated feature changes (Hero, HeroHelper, Wallet/CreditCard, styling/theme, assets/text), which are outside the requested admin restoration scope.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Header Admin dropdown and /admin/rooms hub must include links to every required admin room; links must match registered routes; navigation usable on desktop/mobile (scrollable).",
      "reason": "The diff summary claims Header/App changes, but no concrete diff content is provided for Header.tsx/App.tsx/adminNav constants or the /admin/rooms hub UI itself. Also, there is no evidence that the dropdown/hub includes links to *every* required room (approvals, editing, uploads, pricing/terms, price control, image library, wallet management, ads, affiliate, member directory, invite links, display screen, mall admin).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Every /admin/* route must be guarded; non-admin/logged-out users see existing AdminAccessDenied; admin checks resilient to identity changes without hard refresh.",
      "reason": "AdminRouteGuard and useAdminStatus improvements are shown, but there is no diff evidence that *every* /admin/* route is wrapped/guarded (router configuration in App.tsx is not shown, only described in a summary).",

      "reason": "Only three admin pages are evidenced as modified (AdminAdsPage, AdminAffiliatePage, AdminMemberDirectoryPage).

      "reason": "The diff includes broad, unrelated modifications to many non-admin areas (Hero, content components, Footer, Wallet/CreditCard pages, CSS/theme, Tailwind config).
