  "summary": "Diff restores an admin navigation data source and updates Header/AdminRouteGuard to expose/admin-gate /admin/* routes with desktop + mobile handling. However, the diff summary also indicates a wide set of unrelated UI/feature changes (HeroHelper voice/memory, homepage/theming, wallet BTC integration, etc.) that were not requested. Admin moderation approve/reject/upload functionality across all pending item types cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary (backend implementation is truncated; hooks are only described in a file summary).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Provide admins full moderation capabilities for all option rooms requiring approval (upload/create where applicable; approve/reject for every pending item type shown in UI; backend enforces admin-only; UI shows success/failure and refreshes lists; no silent no-ops).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows capability-detection plumbing and mentions query hooks, but does not provide concrete evidence that every approval-focused admin page has working Approve/Reject (and upload/create where applicable) wired end-to-end with backend methods and UI refresh/outcome handling. backend/main.mo changes are truncated and do not show the required approve/reject methods or admin-only enforcement for each pending item type.",

      "requirement": "Eliminate regressions/errors introduced after v44 related to the admin menu and admin room actions; app must build/run cleanly; admin navigation/actions must not throw uncaught exceptions.",
      "reason": "Build cleanliness and absence of runtime/console errors cannot be verified from the diff summary alone, and the diff includes many unrelated changes that could introduce regressions. No test/build evidence is provided in the diff summary.",
