  "summary": "Diff implements frontend-side admin route guarding and various UI/theme/layout changes, plus additional hooks/pages updates to address build issues. However, the required generated 5D background image assets are not evidenced as added, and backend support for a stable admin-check method is not clearly evidenced in the truncated backend diff. Several unrelated feature enhancements (not requested) appear to have been introduced (notably a greatly expanded HeroHelper/AI assistant and people-free homepage background changes).",

      "requirement": "Backend exposes a stable admin-check method used by the frontend (e.g., the actor method checked by useIsCallerAdmin) and it returns correct values for admin vs non-admin callers.",
      "reason": "Frontend now calls actor.isCallerAdmin() (via useIsCallerAdmin) and App routes are wrapped with AdminRouteGuard, but the backend diff shown is truncated and does not provide evidence that a public isCallerAdmin method exists and is correct.",
